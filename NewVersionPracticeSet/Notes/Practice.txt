Creating Coach interface and a class for implementation as Component
then in my controller declare Coach as variable and create constructor and then use @GETMAPPING for calling;
Also do the same with Setter Injection and also field injection

--> Field injectin is not recommended it makes the code harder to unit test


Create another package outside the main package in com.nilesh and add your interface and implemented class in the new package
and now try to run your project, solution in @SpringBootApplication add scanBasePackages

create another implementation of the same interface and add qualifier in my controller
